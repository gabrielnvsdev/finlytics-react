# Finlytics

Finlytics is a front-end financial dashboard built with React that allows users to visualize market data such as stocks and currencies using public APIs.

The goal of this project is to provide a clean and interactive interface for exploring financial data, tracking favorite assets, and comparing performance — all running entirely on the client side, without any backend.
